Makes glass panes render with a connected texture in Minecraft 1.9 snapshots.

Requires the Meddle loader, with the DynamicMappings and MeddleAPI mods installed.

# ConnectedGlassX

This is a fork of [FyberOptic/ConnectedGlass](https://github.com/FyberOptic/ConnectedGlass).

I was recently playing the April Fools' version 1.RV-pre1. Since I couldn't find any working Forge or Optifine support, I used Meddle. I looked for a mod within the Meddle ecosystem that provided connected textures and found the aforementioned ConnectedGlass by FyberOptic. Originally, only glass panes were still supported in 1.RV-pre1; I have made some modifications, and it now supports more block types.
